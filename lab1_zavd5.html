<div><a id="example"></a><h3>Keyboard</h3></div>
<p>A computer keyboard is a peripheral input device modeled after the typewriter keyboard
    which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Replacing early
    punched cards and paper tape technology, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards have been the main input method
    for computers since the 1970s, supplemented by the computer mouse since the 1980s.

    Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have a set of characters engraved or printed on them, and each press of a key
    typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, producing some symbols may require pressing and holding
    several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keys produce characters (letters, numbers or symbols),
    other keys (such as the escape key) can prompt the computer to execute system commands. In a modern computer, the
    interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software: the information sent to the computer, the scan
    code, tells it only which physical key (or keys) was pressed or released.

    In normal usage, the keyboard is used as a text entry interface for typing text, numbers, and symbols into
    application software such as a word processor, web browser or social media app.</p>

<div><a id="example1"></a><h3>Drive</h3></div>
<p>A drive is a location (medium) that is capable of storing and reading information that is not
    easily removed, like a disk or disc. All drives store files and programs used by your computer. For example, when
    you write a letter in a word processor, the program is loaded from the hard drive. When you save the document, it's
    saved to the hard drive or other disk or drive. The picture is an example of different drives listed in Microsoft
    Windows My Computer.<br>
    Understanding how drives work on your computer is the first step in identifying the drives connected to your
    computer. Computers running a Microsoft operating system (e.g., MS-DOS and Windows) with a floppy drive have either
    A: or B: depending on the type of floppy drive. If your computer does not have a floppy drive (most computers
    today), the A: and B: drive will be missing.

    Your primary hard drive is always be the C: drive. If it is partitioned, it may also have additional drive letters
    for each partition. However, the primary partition will be C:.

    Next, if your computer has a disc drive, it defaults as the next available drive letter. The disc drive is often D:
    or E:, but may be a different drive letter if your computer has multiple drives and partitions.</p>

<div><a id="example2"></a><h3>Vehicle audio</h3></div>
<p>Vehicle audio is equipment installed in a car or other vehicle to provide in-car entertainment and
    information for the vehicle occupants. Until the 1950s it consisted of a simple AM radio. Additions since then have
    included FM radio (1952), 8-track tape players, cassette players, record players, CD players (1984), DVD players,
    Blu-ray players, navigation systems, Bluetooth telephone integration, and smartphone controllers like CarPlay and
    Android Auto. Once controlled from the dashboard with a few buttons, they can now be controlled by steering wheel
    controls and voice commands.

    Initially implemented for listening to music and radio, vehicle audio is now part of car telematics,
    telecommunication, in-vehicle security, handsfree calling, navigation, and remote diagnostics systems. The same
    loudspeakers may also be used to minimize road and engine noise with active noise control, or they may be used to
    augment engine sounds, for instance making a smaller engine sound bigger.<br>
    In 1904, well before commercially viable technology for mobile radio was in place, American inventor and
    self-described "Father of Radio" Lee de Forest did some demonstration around a car radio at the 1904 Louisiana
    Purchase Exposition in St. Louis.

    Around 1920, vacuum tube technology had matured to the point where the availability of radio receivers made radio
    broadcasting viable. A technical challenge was that the vacuum tubes in the radio receivers required 50 to 250
    volt direct current, but car batteries ran at 6V. Voltage was stepped up with a vibrator that provided a pulsating
    DC which could be converted to a higher voltage with a transformer, rectified, and filtered to create higher-voltage
    DC.</p>
